This is a PC-only website. All of the features and animations are designed specifically for PCs.

Also, the server.js program is the backend of the website.
By default, the website will be hosted at http://0.0.0.0:16000 once the backend is run.

Note: keep everything except for server.js in a folder named "public" in the same directory as server.js in order for it to work.

By default, the idea submissions will be stored under Documents>>>Kidpreneur>>>Submissions with a specifc name created for each submission.
The data submitted will be inside metadata.txt and the attachments will be inside this "Attachments" folder in the same folder as metadata.txt

On the website being hosted at "https://avivvasani.github.io/kidpreneur", the backend will not work as it has not been setup
